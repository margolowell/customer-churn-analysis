"],"metadata":{"id":"Qc4kP8qaOafR"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question 16:\n","The two features with the strongest relationship to churn was the type of Contract and the Tenure Groups. For the type of Contract churn rate was way higher than the other two contract types. The month-to-month customers have a churn rate of 16.02%. This is much higher than the 2.21% for one-year customers and the 2.81% for two-year customers. Month-to-month customers also had the highest average charges with $81.52. The business context is that the customers with the lowest commitment and the highest bills are likely. Tenure showed a similar pattern to Contracts. Tenure has a strong relationship to churn as the churn rate by tenure group decreases with the more months of a customer. Customers with less than 12 months had 10.54% while customers with more than 9.58%. Customers with less months had higher churn rates than those with more months. In conclusion newer customers with shorter contract are more likely to churn. A recommendation is to target these groups with strategies to increase retention. This could be incentives to switch plans or discounts for longer commitment."],"metadata":{"id":"KA3ttqHIRfFE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question 17: One limitation is that the data set can't tell us the reason why month-to-month customers have higher churn rates. The data can't prove that the contract type is the reason for higher churn rates. Additionally, we aren't able to see what the competitors are offering or other outside factors. So ultimately it's hard to see what is actually causing the customers to leave. Another limitation is that some of the feature overlap. Contract type and tenure are automatically related because if a customer has a longer contract, they will spend more time at Regork. This makes it difficult to determine if the features are independent of each other or not. A next step would create a model to predict such as Logistic Regression or a Random Forest to measure feature importance and coefficients. You could also split the data in training and test sets to see if the patterns shown above can be generalized."],"metadata":{"id":"Oc-DCY3cfPcm"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Part 2:

was 0.2003, but the F1 score on the test set dropped to a much lower score of 0.1132. The difference of 0.0871 suggests overfitting as the model didn't perform well on the new data because it was trained to specific on the training data.\n","*   Question 34: Generalization deals with a model's ability to to accurately predict, in this case, customers that it hasn't seen before. Generalization is being able to predict future customer not just past customers. With the low F1 scores, this model will not do well in predicting the churn rates 0f future customers. One concern I have for the future performance is that the data is imbalanced. Most of the customers stay so customers who churn are rarer and it is harder for the model to learn.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"zX9ho4bmYOFX"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question 35: The top two features of the Permutation Importance are cat__InternetService_Fiber_optic and cat__Contract_Month-to-month. The first feature,cat__InternetService_Fiber_optic means that that customers are subscribed to fiber optic internet. The second feature, at__Contract_Month-to-month, means that the customers have the shorter, month-to-month contract. This means that customers with fiber optic internet and the shorter contract were more likely to churn. Regork should focus on the retention on these two groups specifically the shorterm contract holders with fiber optic internet. Discounts or rewards for switching to a year or two year contract could help with retention. For the fiber optic internet, Regork should focus on lower the costs or the increasing the service and quality to customers as this is a more premium internet experience.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"b763_xwF6Ieq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question 36: I recommend the Decision Tree model to Regork. Even though its test accuracy of about 86% is slightly lower than the Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, Recall and F1 Score are more important for churn prediction because the business cares most about identifying customers who are likely to leave. The Decision Tree achieved the highest Recall with 0.0843 and the highest F1 Score of 0.1132. Ultimately the Decision Tree is detecting more churners than the others. The Random Forest model was the most stable across cross-validation and testing. This means there is less risk of overfitting. The Recall of the RandomForest was extremely low with a score of 0.0056. So even though Random Forest is stable, it isn't good at predicting with customers are likely to leave. The ultimate goal of Regork is to reduce the number of churned customers, so it is more important to be able to identify customers who are likely to leave."],"metadata":{"id":"XpZvx2pR6Lnb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Part 3: Open-Ending Modeling Competition"],"metadata":{"id":"G_V5YByB6Qny"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Building the best churn model.\n","\n","I'll be using the XGBoost because it is good for this type of data and it handles the imbalance well.
