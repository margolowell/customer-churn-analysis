# Customer Churn Analysis

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze customer churn data to identify key factors that influence whether a customer is likely to leave. Understanding these drivers can help businesses improve customer retention strategies and reduce revenue loss.

## Data
The dataset contains customer demographic information, account details, service usage, and churn status. Each row represents a customer, with features related to tenure, contract type, billing method, and services used.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Analysis Overview
This project includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis 
- Feature analysis to understand churn patterns
- Predictive modeling to classify customer churn

Several models were tested to evaluate their ability to predict churn, and performance was compared using appropriate evaluation metrics.

## Key Insights
- Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn
- Contract type and billing method have a strong relationship with churn
- Monthly charges and service combinations impact churn probability
- Predictive models can reasonably identify high-risk customers
